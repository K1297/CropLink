CropLink is an AgriTech Dapp that revolutionizes the way farmers sell their produce. It provides a decentralized platform where farmers can connect with registered Sellers. Farmers can list & add their produce, including name, quantity, and price for sale. They can view and manage their list of produce. Our platform leverages the power of smart contracts and Chainlink oracles to ensure fair and transparent transactions while mitigating the risks associated with unpredictable weather conditions. With the help of Chainlink oracles, CropLink constantly monitors weather patterns, including heavy rainfall that could potentially damage the farmers' produce. In such cases, smart contracts written in solidity automatically activate, enabling farmers to sell their crops to registered Sellers.

CropLink simplifies the onboarding process for farmers, who only need a Metamask account to get started. They also have the option to upload their government-authorized ID to verify their identity, unlocking additional benefit of montly claim from our treasury fund.

Additionally, CropLink utilizes AWS services to enhance the scalability and reliability of our platform, providing a seamless experience for all users.

# Architecture

## Components

* **Frontend**: This is the user interface where farmers and sellers interact with the Dapp. It can be a
web-based interface.
* **Sign in with metamask**: Users can connect their accounts using a MetaMask.
* **Backend**: This is the server-side of the Dapp. 
* **AWS**: AWS provides for storing user data, and networking for communication between different components.
* **Dynamo DB**: Dynamo DB for storing user data.
* **CropLink smart contract**: The smart contracts written in Solidity. It includes the core logic of the Dapp, including functions for farmers to sell their produce, sellers to buy produce. 
* **Chainlink**: The Chainlink is responsible for fetching external data, such as weather
information.
