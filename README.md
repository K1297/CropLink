CropLink is an AgriTech Dapp that revolutionizes the way farmers sell their produce. It provides a decentralized platform where farmers can connect with registered Sellers. Farmers can list & add their produce, including name, quantity, and price. They can view and manage their list of produce. Our platform leverages the power of smart contracts and Chainlink oracles to ensure fair and transparent transactions while mitigating the risks associated with unpredictable weather conditions. With the help of Chainlink oracles, CropLink constantly monitors weather patterns, including heavy rainfall that could potentially damage the farmers' produce. In such cases, smart contracts written in solidity automatically activate, enabling farmers to sell their crops to registered Sellers at their desired prices. 

By incorporating reliable data feeds, Chainlink VRF, Chainlink Keepers, and Chainlink API, CropLink ensures that farmers have access to accurate and real-time information about the prices, demand, and supply of the crops they grow, in a decentralized and secure manner. CropLink simplifies the onboarding process for farmers, who only need a Metamask account to get started. They also have the option to upload their government-authorized ID to verify their identity, unlocking additional benefit of montly claim from our treasury fund. On the other hand, Sellers are required to register themselves using official documents authorized by the government, ensuring transparency and authenticity throughout the platform. 

Additionally, CropLink utilizes AWS services to enhance the scalability and reliability of our platform, providing a seamless experience for all users.

# Architecture

## Components

* **Frontend**: This is the user interface where farmers and sellers interact with the Dapp. It can be a
web-based interface accessible through a browser, and users can connect their accounts using a
tool like MetaMask.
* **Backend**: The backend consists of smart contracts written in Solidity. It
includes the core logic of the Dapp, including functions for farmers to sell their produce, sellers to
buy produce, and retrieving price, demand, and supply information from the Chainlink Oracle.
* **Chainlink Oracle**: The Chainlink Oracle is responsible for fetching external data, such as weather
information and market prices, and providing it to the smart contracts. It can use Chainlink
Keepers, Data Feeds, or APIs to retrieve and update data. In this case, the oracle checks weather
conditions, such as heavy rainfall, which may affect the produce.
* **Truflation Data**: Truflation Data is an external service that provides accurate and reliable market
data related to produce prices, demand, and supply. The Chainlink Oracle can use this service to
retrieve the required information and feed it into the smart contracts.
* **AWS Services**: AWS provides a range of cloud services that can be utilized by the Dapp. This
includes storage for storing user data, compute for running backend processes, and networking
for communication between different components.
